# umocktypes_windows requirements

# Overview

`umocktypes_windows` is a module that exposes out of the box functionality for several Windows types.

The types are implemented as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)

# Exposed API

```c
int umocktypes_windows_register_types(void);
```

## umocktypes_windows_register_types

```c
int umocktypes_windows_register_types(void);
```
